  - [x] Documnetation
    - Checkpoint: 19.08.2023
  - [ ] C4 architecture notation
  - [x] EDA & preprocessing
    - Checkpoint: 26.08.2023

  To-do at this step:
- add data in zip format to data/initial_data
- rewrite data_prep/data_preprocessing.py with correct functions style
- add necessary functions for loading and saving to utils.py (load initial data from .zip format)


  - [ ] Jupyter Nootebook research + Airflow realisation
  - [ ] Baseline & realisation
    - Checkpoint: 02.09.2023
  - [ ] The optimal metric for evaluating the solution was analyzed, the baseline and the target solution were evaluated, and the solution parameters improving the metrics were selected
  - [ ] All components from the product architecture for operation of the store application are lifted
    - Checkpoint: 09.09.2023
  - [ ] The solution is implemented on airflow and clearml/mlflow/flask
  - [ ] Solution provided to the customer: Product architecture, model scoring, description of features and EDA results
    - Checkpoint: 16.09.2023
