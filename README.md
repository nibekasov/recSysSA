# recSysSoA
My team project on RecSys 

Here should be ML System Design + Integration with other parts of project(FrontEnd, DataEngeneering, simple BackEnd) 

Objective & Key Results:
* Objectives:

  Create an app for marketplace. Architecture includes:
    - RecSys to give customers recommendations for items they could need
    - Simple Backend to connect ML and our project
    - Simle Frontend to show how algorithm is working
  
* Key Results:
  - [ ] Documnetation
    - Checkpoint: 19.08.2023
  - [ ] C4 architecture notation
  - [ ] EDA & preprocessing
    - Checkpoint: 26.08.2023
  - [ ] JupyterNootbook research + Airflow realisation
  - [ ] Baseline & realisation
    - Checkpoint: 02.09.2023
  - [ ] The optimal metric for evaluating the solution was analyzed, the baseline and the target solution were evaluated, and the solution parameters improving the metrics were selected
  - [ ] All components from the product architecture for operation of the store application are lifted
    - Checkpoint: 09.09.2023
  - [ ] The solution is implemented on airflow and clearml/mlflow/flask
  - [ ] Solution provided to the customer: Product architecture, model scoring, description of features and EDA results
    - Checkpoint: 16.09.2023
